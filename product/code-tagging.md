# Code Tagging

## Purpose

In order to start bringing categorisation to solutions submitted, we can adopt suggestive tagging that would feed a machine learning mechanism.

## Display

The suggestive tagging would present what `Concepts` the system thinks the submission contains or uses during the mentoring process. The fields are entirely optional to select or complete.

The seed data for the recommendations would come from mentors being prompted to say what `Concepts` are being used.

## Availability

Code tagging is only available on Practice exercises. This is because `Concept` exercises already acutely cover the `Concept` that is almost always going to be used in the solution.
